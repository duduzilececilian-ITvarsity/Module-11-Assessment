                <h1>Noma</h1>
                <p>Copenhagen, Denmark</p> <br/>   
                <p><strong>How does it work?</strong> Noma offers three menus at different times of year, with seafood season from January to June, vegetable season during the summer and game and forest in the winter. The restaurant closes before each season so that its R&amp;D team, led by talented head Mette Søberg, can develop new menu items from whatever the land and sea provide.</p>
                <p><strong>What to expect:</strong> No trip to Noma is ever the same, with Redzepi and team constantly foraging for unexpected ingredients and turning them into beautiful plates. Highlights from previous seasons include a groundbreaking vegetarian celeriac shawarma, a duck dish of leg, brain and heart served with claw, feather and beak, and sweet crab meat served on a flatbread cut into the shape of a crab. Summer 2021 included standout dishes such as fried cod collar with crème fraiche and caviar.</p>
                <p><strong>From fermentation to foraging:</strong> Noma’s vast new digs in Copenhagen’s artsy Refshalevej Island include a state-of-the-art fermentation kitchen, where director Jason White experiments with koji, garum and miso to create fascinating flavour combinations. The entire team regularly forage for new ingredients, working with everything from reindeer penis (yes, seriously) to deer brain and all manner of bugs.</p>
