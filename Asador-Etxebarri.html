                <h1>Asador Extebarri</h1>
                <p>Atxondo, Spain</p><br/>
                <p><strong>Food meets art:</strong> The restaurant respects the intrinsic natural flavours of local produce and delicately urges each ingredient to show its potential: house-made chorizo, salted anchovies, buffalo cheese, the freshest prawns from Palamos, tender beef chops. Even the desserts – such as reduced milk ice cream with raspberries – are kissed with at least a suggestion of smoke.</p>
                <p><strong>Meet the chef:</strong> Born in a country house only a kilometre away from where Etxebarri is located in the village of Axtondo, Arguinzoniz fell in love with the magic of fire as a kid. His family house had no electricity or gas and he remembers fondly the times when his mother and grandmother cooked on the open hearth. Despite a stellar 30-year career, the chef has remained as humble as he was on his first day in the kitchen.</p>
                <p><strong>How about the view?</strong> In the lush foothills of the Spanish Basque Country, Asador Etxebarri has been housed in the same rustic stone building since the 1990s. With sprawling views of mountains and grazing cattle from its terrace (where the welcome snacks are served), the restaurant can claim to be at one with history and nature.</p>
