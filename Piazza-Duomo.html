                <h1>Piazza Duomo</h1>
                <p>Alba, Italy</p><br/>
                <p><strong>What to expect: </strong>A taste of Piedmont, one of the finest food and wine regions of the world, as seen through the sharply focused culinary lens of Enrico Crippa, now firmly established among Italy’s most creative chefs. Diners can choose from different tasting menus: in 2021, one pays homage to Barolo and the culinary traditions of Piedmont through modernist eyes, while another – called ‘the journey menu Crippa XXI’ – is the most personal outlet of the chef’s own creativity. Both are developed using organic and biodynamic ingredients.</p>
                <p><strong>More about the chef:</strong> Crippa opened Piazza Duomo in 2005 with the backing of the Ceretto family, themselves pioneers in the region’s winemaking resurgence of recent decades. A quiet and supremely dedicated professional, he trained and worked extensively in Europe and Japan and was mentored by legendary Italian chef Gaultiero Marchesi.</p>
                <p><strong>Highlights: </strong>  The restaurant’s most famous dish is the Salad 21...31...41...51... which incorporates a cornucopia of leaves, herbs and vegetables, the precise number and make-up of which changes according to the season. However, it is the array of one- or two-bite flavour-filled starters – also primarily sourced from Piazza Duomo’s own garden – that linger longest in diners’ memories.</p>
