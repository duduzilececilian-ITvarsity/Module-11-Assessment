                <h1>DiverXO</h1>
                <p>Madrid, Spain</p><br/>
                <p><strong>In a nutshell: </strong> A wacky wonderland of a restaurant, Diverxo – styled as DiverXO – is the brainchild of Dabiz Muñoz, known for his daring approach to dishes, and widely considered one of the world’s most creative cooks.</p>
                <p><strong>About the chef: </strong> As a young child, Muñoz knew exactly what he wanted when he grew up – a wildly popular restaurant where people would queue for hours for a table. His father was sceptical, telling him that ‘pigs might fly’, but Muñoz got the last laugh – after training at top restaurants in London and Madrid, he opened Diverxo in 2007 and soon became the second-youngest person in the world to earn three-star Michelin status, at 33 years old. Now he proudly displays flying pigs throughout the restaurant, showing the world the power of achieving the seemingly unachievable.</p>
                <p><strong>Sweet vs savoury: </strong>  Muñoz doesn’t believe there is a point where savoury stops and sweet begins, so his desserts feature plenty of surprising flavours. A selection of mochi at the end of the meal incorporates fillings such as cottage cheese, parmesan and even tom kha kai soup with Thai basil.</p>
